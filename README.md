Localization
==
This is an implementation of three-dimensional localization microscopy through deep learning on Matlab (Matconvnet) as well as Python (Keras and TensorFlow). The model bases on a deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to retrieve the 3D locations of the fluorophores from a single 2D image captured by a conventional wide-field fluorescence microscope. The challenging 3D localization is converted from an ill-posed model-based fitting problem, especially with dense samples and low signal-to-noise ratio, to a solvable multi-label classification problem through two cascaded CNNs. <bt>
